Project Description: Next.js Portfolio Deployment on AWS with Terraform

This project involves deploying a modern, responsive portfolio website for a web designer to a highly available and globally accessible cloud environment. The site was built with Next.js, and the objective is to host it on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure consistency, scalability, and repeatability.

The deployment uses Terraform to provision and manage all AWS resources. The architecture is designed to support global content delivery and optimized performance through Amazon S3 for static site hosting and AWS CloudFront as the Content Delivery Network (CDN). This setup provides low latency, high availability, and cost efficiency. Additional considerations include secure configurations, performance optimizations, and reproducible workflows for future updates or enhancements.

Key Deliverables
Static Next.js site hosted in Amazon S3
CloudFront distribution configured for global content delivery
Infrastructure as Code automation using Terraform
AWS security and performance best practices applied
Source code and provisioning scripts managed in GitHub

This project demonstrates the practical application of cloud deployment, automation, scalability planning, and performance optimization in a real-world client scenario.
